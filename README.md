## A few simple treatments of the Hubbard model

Here I present code to develop the solutions for treatments of the Hubbard model, inluding: 

### t=0,  single-site approximation
### exact diagonalization for a 1x2 lattice
### exact diagonalization for a 2x2 lattice 

Both of the exact diagonalization codes assume half-filling and an equal number
of spin up and spin down particles.    The 2x2 code can be generalized for 3D
lattices of arbitrary sites lxmxn, however not a lot of testing
has been performed for systems above 1x2x2.
